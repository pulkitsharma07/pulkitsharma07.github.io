Hello, welcome to my personal blog. I am a Software Engineer by profession with over 8 years of experience in the industry. I like working on developer tools and improving engineering productivity.

Most of my work in my current job @ BrowserStack is on the backend (platform / databases / networking / reverse engineering), outside of work I have dabbled with various frontend frameworks and built various mini-projects. I have not been able to fully release them due to other priorities in life... You can find some small scripts/demos on my Github profile here: https://github.com/pulkitsharma07. As for the frontend tech stack I have experimented with Svelte and ReactJS. I liked Svelte initially but these days I am most comfortable in ReactJS (NextJS + Tailwind stack specifically) as it gives a somewhat complete package for UI development. For quick fullstack prototypes, I can always fallback to the trusty and mighty: Ruby on Rails.

As for my educational background: I am not that educated :-D , I did by B.Tech. in Computer Science from Jaypee University, Guna in India. I had a CGPA of 6.4, and I had a bad relation with most of my professors due to lack of alignment on core values and purpose of education, I was barred from the placement cell because I refused to sit for placements for Infosys. I was pretty average student in school, scoring on average about 70% and max around 80% (once). 

These days, > 90% of what I know is because of the internet, and I consider the internet to be my "Guru".

I am an aspiring polymath and have been keenly interested in various fields: Gaming, Spirituality, Religion, Philosophy, Psychology, and Music. On my YouTube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/@46september I have uploaded few drum and guitar covers of songs from Tool, Opeth, Linkin Park, etc. As for my theological pursuits, I have basic understanding of Advaita Vedanta, Buddhism and some kind of crude high level overview of Abrahamic religions. I believe religion is not to be taken lightly, it consists of not just stories, dogmas, myths and superstition but also history, psychology and most importantly philosophy. Personally, I find myself in closest alignment with Hinduism, but only it's pure philosophical parts (covered under Upanishads, and commentaries by Shankaracharya). In Gaming, I used to be on the top 200 players in TrackMania Nations United (long time ago) in Asia, I have 2000+ hours in Dota 2 (but I am a noob, not even Archon last I remember). I don't play Dota anymore due to RSI / carpal tunnel symptoms in my right hand (to this day). My favorite games (in no particular order): Elden Ring, Super Hexagon, Factorio, Assassin's Creed / Prince of Persia (really enjoyed them as a kid), Dota.


My interest in programming used to be at the top among other things, but these days I am not that interested in it. To me being too interested in programming is like being too interested in your tools as a carpenter. These days, I am more inclined in applying my toolset of programming and software engineering skills to non-tech problems of our society. I do not want to spend my work hours sitting in front of computer, I have been doing that for more than 12 years already and can already see the effect it has on my body. Honestly, I get too engrossed in technology plus being an introvert doesn't help either.

About this blog: to be honest, I am not sure about the purpose of this blog. The main purpose I guess is that having a blog allows me to write down and focus on one particular topic, and present a kind of "complete" version of thoughts/notes which I have been accumulating since a long time.
