Hi, I am a Software Engineer with over 8 years of experience in the industry. I like working on developer tools and improving engineering productivity.

Since most of my work in my day job is on the backend (platform / databases / networking), outside of work I have dabbled with various frontend frameworks and built various mini-projects. I enjoyed coding small games in Svelte, but these days I am most proficient in ReactJS, i.e with NextJS + Tailwind stack.

I am an aspiring polymath and have been keenly interested in various fields: Gaming, Sprituality, Philosophy, Psychology, and Music. I am interested in applying my programming/software skills to non-tech problems or any other aspects of our soceity.

To be honest, I am not sure about the purpose of this blog. The main purpose I guess is that having a blog allows me to write down and focus on one particular topic, and present a kind of "complete" version of thoughts or notes which I have been accumulating since a long time.
