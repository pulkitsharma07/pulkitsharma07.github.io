## About me
Hi, Pulkit here. It is 12:23 AM on 26th September 2017, a Monday.
Also, I like to headbang when I am alone.

## About this Blog
I plan to keep posts on this blog to be technical and related to programming in general.
But I know it won't remain pristine in the coming days/years. I expect posts related to Music, Life in general to bleed in.
When/If that happens too often, I will probably segregate the posts into separate blogs.
But for now, expect a weird mixup of blog posts.

I am content about that fact that I have started to write. And I am grateful for my life. I do not see any reason, why you should not be :-)
