Hi, I am a Software Engineer with over 6 years of experience in the software engineering industry. I like working on developer tools and improving engineering productivity.

Outside of work, I am passionate about percussion instruments and electronic music, and I enjoy playing the drums and guitar. I hope you find the content helpful and informative.
