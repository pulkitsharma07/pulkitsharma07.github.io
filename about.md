## About me
Hi, my name is Pulkit Sharma and I am a Principal Engineer with over 5 years of experience in the software engineering industry. I have a strong background in a variety of programming languages, including Ruby, Go, Node.js, Python, and Java. I have worked at companies such as BrowserStack and Gitlab, where I have gained valuable experience and honed my skills in the field.

In my current role, I lead a team of talented engineers and oversee the development and implementation of key initiatives, including managing a large mobile device cluster spanning multiple data centers around the world. I am always looking for new ways to improve my skills and stay up to date with the latest technologies in the field, and I am currently learning Elixir and Phoenix.

Outside of work, I am passionate about percussion instruments and electronic music, and I enjoy playing the drums and guitar. I am excited to connect with other professionals in the software engineering industry and explore opportunities for collaboration and growth. Thank you for visiting my blog, and I hope you find the content helpful and informative.
